# Dashboard Prototype Workspace

This repository contains a large majority of our team's draft work and early approaches to developing a dashboard. 

You'll notice there is a collection of folders found under the Scripts folder, these detail early iterations of our workflow, as well as, ideas for future scaffolding. To see the final version of the dashboard contents workflow, please visit our official repository: https://github.com/GaiaFuture/CLM5_PPE_Emulator

### File Structure and Contents
```
Prototype
│   README.md
│   gitignore
│   Data_Generation_Data_Repo.ipynb (notebook with the script to generate archived data)     
│
└───Results 
    │   contains files associated with the data our team generated. This includes preprocessed data, the predictions generated by the emulator, and our data visualizations
│
└───Environment_Details 
    │   contains files with the necessary components to create the same virtual environment we used to test our dashboard
│
└───Script 
    │   contains files used by the students to generate the functionalities that will appear in the finla product. This is broken up into notebooks outlining the interactivity and design of the dashboard ni the Dashboard folder, and adding the final capabilities to the emulator in the Emulator folder.
